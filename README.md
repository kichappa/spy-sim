## Project Overview:
Our project revolves around the creation of a simulation environment for artificial life. We aim to model and study the behaviors of agents in various scenarios, with a particular focus on military border control and small combat situations. This simulation allows us to explore and experiment with agent-based systems in these contexts.

## Repository Contents:
In this repository, you'll find:

Simulation Code: The source code for our artificial life simulation, including the main algorithms and models in the programming language "Julia".

Documentation: Detailed documentation, including a README file, project report, and any necessary instructions to run the simulation.

Data and Results: This section includes any data generated during the simulation, as well as our analysis and results.
